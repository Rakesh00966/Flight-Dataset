# ✈️ Flights Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Flights Dataset (2013)**, which contains more than **336,000 flight records**.  
The goal is to analyze **flight delays, schedules, distances, and carrier performance**, and extract meaningful insights.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **21 columns** with flight details such as departure time, arrival delay, distance, and airline carrier.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA
- ✅ Most flights depart between **5 AM – 8 PM**  
- ✅ **United Airlines, JetBlue, and ExpressJet** operate the most flights  
- ✅ **Departure delays and arrival delays are strongly correlated (0.91)**  
- ✅ Delays increase in **June, December, and evenings (3 PM – 10 PM)**  
- ✅ Longer distance → higher air time (correlation: 0.99)  
- ✅ Some carriers (**EV, F9, FL, YV**) show **higher delays**  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Flight distribution across time of day  
- Delay patterns across months and carriers  
- Distance vs Air Time scatter plot    

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook**  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Predictive modeling for **delay forecasting**  
- Time-series analysis on delays  
- Comparative study across airlines
